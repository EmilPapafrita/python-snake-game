# python-snake-game

The snake game I programmed is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game window. The game is implemented using Python and Pygame module for graphics and user input. I had help from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ and used a sample code that they provided to get started. I changed quite a few things to make it more visually pleasing since the original code only had a black screen, simple colors, and used squares to represent the fruit. I added colorful visuals, including a grass background and alternating patterns of red and yellow segments for the snake's body. Additionally, I used an image of three different fruits(apple, mango, orange) that are randomly selected from a collection of fruit images to then be displayed randomly on the game window. The code uses various functions to handle game logic, display scores, manage the snake's movement, and detect collisions.

The goal is to eat fruits that appear on the screen while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the window's boundaries. The snake grows longer each time it consumes a fruit, adding a new segment to its body. The snake's movement is controlled using arrow keys, and the score is displayed as the number of fruits consumed. 

Here is an image of the game while being ran:
